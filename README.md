# TheMsnProject - My Beginnings

## (MOVED) MSN2

My programming language, msn2, has moved to its own repository, find its new home here: [msnscript2](https://github.com/masonmarker/msnscript2)

The existing project folder will remain in this repository under `msnscript2/`, but all future development will be done in the new repository.

#### TheMsnProject is a comprehensive repository for several different projects

- My first Java projects exist at the top level under folders
  `Classes/`
  `External/Drawing/`
  `Msc/`
  `Msn/`
  `MsnCLib/`
  `NeuralNetwork/`
  `Testing/`
  - These Java projects work with files such as
    - `.classpath`, `.project`, `english3.txt`, `miglayout-src.zip`, `miglayout15-swing.jar`, `names.txt`, and `recentmsnworkspace.txt`
