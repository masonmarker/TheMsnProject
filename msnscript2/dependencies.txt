--- GENERAL DEPENDENCIES
---     don't feel overwhelmed by this list!! ,

    these are all the dependencies used
    by the ENTIRE msn2 interpreter, not all programs
    will even use a single one of these dependencies (this is as of 2.0.387), 
    as they are imported when an msn2 program requests them to be imported.
    
    see the source code (msnint2.py) to find out what msn2 code
    imports what dependencies.


for HTML and web scraping:
pip install bs4
pip install html5lib
pip install requests-html

for openai and chatgpt interactions:
pip install openai
pip install tiktoken
pip install langchain

for starting api endpoints and interacting:
pip install requests
pip install flask
pip install flask_restful
pip install flask_cors

for windows automation:
pip install -U pywinauto

for excel and spreadsheet interactions:
pip install openpyxl

for clipboard interactions:
pip install pyperclip

for JavaScript parsing
pip install esprima
pip install jsbeautifier

you can install all of the above 'pip' installs via
    "{python_alias} install_deps.py"
if you plan on using the entirety of msn2's functionality,
otherwise unnecessary dependencies will be installed.

-- LANG DEPENDENCIES
    you will have a need to install these dependencies
    on your machine if you want to use msn2 calls such as
    those specified below.

JavaScript "JS()" in msn2: 
    node.js

C "C()" in msn2: 
    gcc  (easily installed with 'choco install mingw')
              (this switches Python alias to 'py', and you
               may have to reinstall dependencies)

Java "JAVA()" in msn2:
    To install Java you need to install 
    the JDK (Java Development Kit) on your system.
