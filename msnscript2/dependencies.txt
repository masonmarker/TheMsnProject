--- GENERAL DEPENDENCIES
---     don't feel overwhelmed by this list!! ,

    these are all the dependencies used
    by the ENTIRE msn2 interpreter, not all programs
    will even use a single one of these dependencies (this is as of 2.0.387), 
    as they are imported when an msn2 program requests them to be imported.
    
    see the source code (msnint2.py) to find out what msn2 code
    imports what dependencies.
