This folder offers capabilities as a portable MSNScript2 Interpreter.

Dependencies are not automatically installed within the new location,
so verify the dependencies in ../dependencies.txt are installed in the new directory.

PORTABLE MSN2:

    .msn2 programs can be run in any location, not just in the msnscript2 respository.
    
    Run "{python_alias} msn2cli.py portable" to create a package named "msn2"
    within the portable directory that can be copied to your project directories
    so you can run .msn2 code in your own environments.

    Anytime a package is created, this package is created with the most recent
    versions of the MSN2 Interpreter.
