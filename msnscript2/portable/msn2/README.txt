This directory (msn2) can now be copied into
your project folders / directories.

You should create your .msn2 program files within the same directory
as this README.txt (msn2).

This package has access to it's own lib directory,
therefore, your created .msn2 program files can import files
in the exact manner of those existing outside of this package.

ex: import ('lib/timer.msn2')

Run .msn2 programs from this directory with the following syntax:
'python msn2.py *****.msn2'

Good luck!
