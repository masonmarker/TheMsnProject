Demonstrates execution of a .msn2 script within a Python environment, 
showing how a .msn2 script takes input, and gives it back.

To run this small project, we begin from a Python environment,
then use MSN2 capabilities to perform complex operations in less code,
then return to the Python environment.

To start the program, execute '{python_alias} TUTORIAL/python/start.py'
from the msnscript2/ directory.
