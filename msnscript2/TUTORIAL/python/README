Demonstrates execution of a .msn2 script within a Python environment, 
showing how a .msn2 script takes input, and gives it back.

To run this small project, we begin from a Python environment,
then use MSN2 capabilities to perform complex operations in less code,
then return to the Python environment.

To start the program, execute 'python TUTORIAL/python/start.py'
from the msnscript2 directory.

The msn2python.py and msnint2.py files have been copied here as an example.
Therefore, this could be an out-of-date interpreter, however
should still work properly for its reason to be in this directory.
