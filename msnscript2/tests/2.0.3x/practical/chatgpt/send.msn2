# Sends a message to ChatGPT, and retrieves the response.
# 
# Why use this as opposed to OpenAI's ChatGPT API?
# A: 
#   1. No API key
#   2. No charge per request
#   3. Model settings pre-determined and refined by OpenAI's team
#   4. ChatGPT's algorithm for retaining and interpreting the previous messages
#      is maintained (THIS IS ABSOLUTELY HUGE AND CRUCIAL TO 
#      UTILIZING GPT'S COMPLETE CAPABILITIES)
