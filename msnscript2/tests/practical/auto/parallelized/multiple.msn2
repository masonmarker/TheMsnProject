# Tests basic actions within the automation capabilities
# of the language. Uses a multiple threads of execution
# to find elements.
#
# As of 6/5/2023, there is no speedup between this 
# and the single thread version of this script, I don't
# believe their is enough work to be done to actually see
# a speedup.
