# Testing long strings.
#
# ls() and longstring()
#
#
# It's important to know the limitations of the two functions.
#
# ls() and longstring() perform the same logic as script(), however to deal with
# commas, the arguments are just concatenated together as a single, long string.
#
# This removes the requirement to escape commas in script() with (,)
