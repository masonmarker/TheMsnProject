# Tests MSN2 conversion to JavaScript

# start tests
import ('tests/resources/start')


# file path for JavaScript conversion
@ path = "hello.jsx"

# Its important to recognize that when
# using the JavaScript converter, only
# MSN2 code is permitted, this includes code
# snippets that are automatically interpreted by Python,
# such as 'print("hello!")'
#
# a function call such as the call above will execute
# normally, without converting any code to JavaScript


# using javascript conversion until
# instructed otherwise
JS:

# write JavaScript code to file
file.write(path, 
    # exporting default App component
    exdefault(
        # main App component
        def('App', 'props', (
            props.get('style')
        ))
    )
)

# no longer using JavaScript, switch
# back to standard MSN2 interpretation
:JS

# # run the script
# delete the file
file.delete(path)
