# Tests MSN2 conversion to JavaScript

# Its important to recognize that when
# using the JavaScript converter, only
# MSN2 code is permitted, this includes code
# snippets that are automatically interpreted by Python,
# such as 'print("hello!")'
#
# a function call such as the call above will execute
# normally, without converting any code to JavaScript


# using javascript conversion until
# instructed otherwise
JS:


file.write('hello.txt', prnt('hey bruh'))




# no longer using JavaScript, switch
# back to general MSN2 interpretation
:JS

@ v = 1
prnt('------------\n', v)
